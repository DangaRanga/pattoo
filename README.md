##About Pattoo
`pattoo` is based on the original `infoset` code created by the [Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org) as part of its annual Calico Challenge program.

They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015.
